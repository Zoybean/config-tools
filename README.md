# Distributed Configuration Files

Sync your shell and editor settings over multiple computers!!
-
Just replace your config files with symlinks to the files in your repo; it's that easy!
No more carting around USBs full of old and new rc files! Once you've made a clever change to one of your rc files, just `commit` and `push`! Then, `pull` it to any of your other computers that could benefit from that change!

Now with scripts to easily update and link files
-
Use `import` to link you local files with the repository  
Use `export` to update the repository with unlinked local files
